# LC-Kanban_Board

## Description  

Kanban board page built with angular using a node server for storing changes. I didn't develop the node server!



## Setup
### Requirements
  Angular CLI: 13.0.3
  
  Node: 14.18.1
  
  Package Manager: yarn 1.22.17
  
### Server

  First of all go to the BACK folder in your terminal and run:
  
  ```
  npm i
  ```
  And then :
  ```
  npm run server
  ```

### Angular project
  On your terminal navigate to this project folder and run: 
  ```
  npm i
  ```
  And then :
  ```
  ng serve -o
  ```
  The app will run in `http://localhost:4200/`. It will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
  
## Usage

The default login and password are 'letscode' and 'lets@123'.
